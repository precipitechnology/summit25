Through hands-on exercises, attendees will learn about RESTful API design, managing HTTP requests and responses, and best practices for making APIs secure and consumable. By the end of this workshop, participants will have built a functioning .NET Minimal API and gained the confidence to expand their automation skills into the world of API development.
